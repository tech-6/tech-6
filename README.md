# Hi there 👋 im Tech.

I write code alot of the time, but here is where my public code lives.
I also run a gaming community/company called [Escape Systems](https://escape.systems).

My recent endavors have been into alot of work into a small game you know about called Minecraft
Creating services to support large scale Minecraft server installations.


I sometimes also let my artistic side out and make some little badges.
